## utterance_tags_v0.1.csv

### Description

This dataset contains 1187 labeled utterances that fall into three categories: COMMAND, QUESTION, and SENTENCE. 
Each label has sub-labels that describe the type of utterance, such as ACTION, DENIAL, QUERY, and REQUEST. 

The purpose of this dataset is to provide labeled examples of various types of commands, questions, and sentences that can be used for training natural language processing (NLP) models.


### Labels

- COMMAND: This label refers to statements that give instructions or orders. These can be further divided into sub-labels ACTION and DENIAL.
  - ACTION: This sub-label refers to commands that instruct the listener to perform an action.
  - DENIAL: This sub-label refers to commands that instruct the listener to refrain from performing an action.
- QUESTION: This label refers to statements that ask for information. These can be further divided into sub-labels QUERY, YESNO and REQUEST.
  - QUERY: This sub-label refers to questions that ask for information or definitions.
  - REQUEST: This sub-label refers to questions that make a request.
  - YESNO: This sub-label refers to questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no"
- SENTENCE: This label refers to statements that do not fit into either of the above categories.
  - EXCLAMATION: This sub-label refers to sentences that express strong emotions such as excitement, surprise, or admiration.
  - SOCIAL: This sub-label refers to sentences that are used in social situations to express well-wishes or greetings.

### Description

This is a dataset for coreference resolution consisting of 184 sentences in CoNNL format. 
The dataset has been manually annotated to include coreference mentions of masculine, feminine, and inanimate entities. 
Additional entries have been included to expand the variety of coreference cases present in the dataset.

Each line of the dataset represents a token and its corresponding part-of-speech tag and entity tag. 
The entity tags denote the start and end of an entity mention, and whether it is a masculine, feminine, or inanimate entity, and if it is the coreference mention, using the BIO scheme.

The dataset is suitable for training feature extractors for coreference resolution models.
